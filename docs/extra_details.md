## Tips

Mobile number for airtime or data can only be a maximum of 10 numbers due to the +234 at the begininng.
The user page should also be able to manually type in their value.

THE CARD SHOULD BE W -834 H - 611 With padding of 26 on all edges of the card. (this is optional as for responsiveness, I gave it a more mobile screen)
Then the padding on the pages should be 300px for left and right by 205px for up and down

Relating the the Usage of Bitnob SDK

The bitnob SDK canot decode payment request in sandbox so I am just mocking it in my demonstration.
However it can generate invoice and the address should be obvious that it can be copied or they can scan the qr code.
